# Fractal Generator 🌀

This project is a mesmerizing fractal generator implemented in JavaScript, designed to create captivating fractal patterns on an HTML canvas. The generator showcases various types of fractals, each represented by distinct classes.

## Introduction 🌌

Fractals are intricate geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. This project leverages JavaScript to draw different types of fractals on an HTML canvas. The goal is to provide a visually engaging experience by exploring the fascinating world of fractal patterns.

## Usage 🚀

To incorporate the fractal generator into your project, simply include the provided JavaScript code in your HTML file. Upon execution, the generator will draw a random fractal on the main canvas and enhance it with a rain effect on a secondary canvas.

## Fractals 🎨

The generator encompasses several classes, each dedicated to a unique type of fractal pattern. Some of the available fractals include:

- Snowflake Fractal ❄️
- Pyramid Fractal 🏰
- Fractal Tree 🌳
- Fractal Triangle 🔺
- Koch Fractal 🌀
- Spiral Fractal 🌀
- Hilbert Curve Fractal 🔄
- Sierpinski Triangle Fractal ▲

Each fractal class comes with distinctive properties and drawing methods. Customize your fractals by adjusting the parameters within each class to achieve desired visual effects.

## Canvas Settings 🖌️

The canvas settings, including dimensions and styles, are configured at the beginning of the JavaScript code. Modify these settings according to your preferences to experiment with different visual outcomes.

## Rain Effect ☔

A rain effect is applied to the secondary canvas, creating a dynamic animation featuring raindrops falling over the generated fractal. This effect is achieved through particle simulation, adding an extra layer of visual interest to the overall experience.

## Acknowledgments 🙏

This project draws inspiration from the inherent beauty of fractals, aiming to provide an immersive visualization of mathematical patterns. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with fractal parameters, and integrate it into your own projects.

Happy fractal exploring! 🎉
